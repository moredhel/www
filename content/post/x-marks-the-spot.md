Here I sit in Watamu on the coast of Kenya, the last month has been a crazy blur of sailing down the east coast of Africa to parties on the beach. Coming back into the 'office' is a huge change of pace.

Our startup has taken a bit of a break for the last month, mostly to think on its future. Where do we go? Do we keep pushing forward with what we're working on? Or do we move elsewhere and break new ground? We have been given a treasure-map, but we have already started digging here, striking gold could be just below us.

So we put down our tools, pull out our thermoses & sit in the shade as we discuss our futures. The places we'll go, the things we'll see.

So what do we do when faced with such a problem? When one has two unknowable paths ahead, which do you forge? This is the question we currently sit with.

But all is not lost, our belly's are full, our mind is at rest & the company is good.
