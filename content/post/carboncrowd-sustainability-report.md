In collaboration with DFINITY, we have released a report on the carbon-emissions of the Internet Computer blockchain.
This is the first step in a series of improvements we plan to make to the Internet Computer, and ultimately to the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.

I won't go into the whole report now, but do have a look at the announcement we jointly made on Medium:

We're really excited about where this will lead, and in helping to shape the industry-standard in regards to real-time measurements!
