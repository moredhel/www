<!-- Hi, welcome to my portfolio & blog site. I'm a cloud-native engineer, CTO and a member of [FikaWorks](https://fika.works) in my professional life, and an explorer in my private life.

My main focuses at work are on making scalable, HA systems, training and documentation to facilitate internal knowledge, and assisting with architectural work to enable future growth and mitigate technical debt. In short, maximising business value for the client.
I enjoy helping scrappy startups get their products live, working in the trenches figuring out issues, all the way up to negotiating enterprise projects across multiple departments and months.

And if you're wanting any technical writing done, reach out and I can [help with that too](/portfolio/writing/). I can help build out a series of articles to promote a new feature,
